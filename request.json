Generate one social media caption (1–280 characters) following these rules:\n   a. If mood is provided, the caption must follow that mood.\n   b. If mood = None, the caption must use only the image content + context.\n   c. If context = None, the caption must use only the image content.\n   d. If both mood and context are missing, generate a natural caption based solely on the image content.\n3. Output only the final caption. No explanations, no image descriptions, no metadata, and no extra text."
